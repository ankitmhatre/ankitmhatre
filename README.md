Hello!!, I am [Ankit](https://ankitmhatre.in) 👋
enjoy your stay here, feel free to [reach out](mailto:ankitmhatre@hotmail.com)
--- 
I’m a versatile **Senior SWE** and **Product Manager**, passionately building scalable products that solve real-world problems. If you ever wonder, "Can I build this? Should I build this? But the MVP... Why should I and How should I?" the answer is probably "Yes!" — and I’m here to help you figure out all of 'em.

When I’m not busy coding or managing product roadmaps, you’ll find me keeping up with the latest in tech or probably in philosophy mode, trying to figure out life’s bigger questions (like what are we humans even trying to do? ).

## 👨‍💻 My Technical Expertise
I'm fluent in tech, so here’s a sneak peek of my arsenal:

- **Programming Languages:** Swift, Java, C, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Python, PHP, Bash (because why stop at one? And no, I don't put HTML or XML here)
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** React.js, Node.js, Express, Flutter, Xcode, UIKit, Laravel, Django, Flask, Redux (yes, I know, it’s a lot or less... trust me, I’ve forgotten more frameworks than I’ve learned in my 9 years of tech)
- **DevOps & Tools:** Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, AWS EC2, Route 53, Netlify, SSL certificates with Let’s Encrypt, CI/CD pipelines (because continuous integration means never having to say, “It worked on my machine”)
- **APIs and Integrations:** RESTful APIs, GraphQL, Postman, MealDB, third-party integrations (AKA, making apps talk to each other, so you don’t have to. But I'm a believer in human connection too)
- **UI/UX & Design Tools:** Figma, SketchApp (because even code needs to look good)
- **Databases:** MongoDB, Firebase, SQL, MySQL (because a project without a database is just a glorified to-do list)
- **Architecture & Patterns:** MVVM, Redux (because structure beats chaos)

### Notable Projects
Here are a few projects that I’m particularly proud of, and no, they weren’t built overnight (unless you count the sleepless nights).

1. **Chitraan (Journaling App)**  
   An app for capturing and organizing thoughts because notebooks are sooo last century. Built with **Flutter**, hosted on **AWS EC2**, and integrated with **MongoDB**. Available on both iOS and Android.

2. **AI-Powered Investment Portfolio Assistant**  
   A web-based tool that helps people experiment with investment strategies. Think of it like a financial playground, without the real-world consequences. Built with **React.js**, **Node.js**, and hosted on **Netlify**.

## 🧑‍💼 Product Management Skills
When I’m not coding, I switch gears into **Product Manager** mode, where I focus on bringing the best possible user experience to life. I like to think of myself as the guy who makes sure everyone is rowing the boat in the same direction (and that there are no holes in it).

- **Product Strategy:** Defining product vision, roadmap planning, and aligning with business goals (and no, it’s not just about making pretty graphs).
- **Agile Methodology:** Leading sprints and avoiding the temptation to sprint into chaos.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Working with everyone from engineers to designers (and occasionally herding cats).
- **Customer-Focused Development:** Listening to the user (and sometimes translating "I want it now" into something realistic).
- **PRD (Product Requirement Document):** Crafting clear and concise PRDs that bridge the gap between tech and business teams.
- **Product Frameworks:** Familiar with frameworks like **Jobs to Be Done**, **Lean Startup**, **OKRs**, and **AARRR (Pirate Metrics)** to measure growth and success.

### Product Leadership Highlights
- **Chitraan:** Managed the full product lifecycle from ideation to launch, ensuring it meets user needs while scaling for growth.

- **AI Portfolio Assistant:** Led the product vision, feature prioritization, and avoided scope creep (it’s a real thing, trust me).

## 🚀 What I’m Excited About
I’m always up for a new challenge, especially if it involves:
- Building products that impact millions of users (or at least hundreds... for now).
- Leveraging **AI/ML** to solve problems (because the future is now).
- Working in a fast-paced environment where caffeine is your best friend. But only **Green Matcha**. Okay?

## 📫 Let's Connect
If I sound like someone you'd like to collaborate with (or just have a friendly chat about tech), here’s how you can reach me:

- **Portfolio:** [ankitmhatre.in](http://ankitmhatre.in?ref=github-readme) (It’s fancy, I promise!)
- **LinkedIn:** [Ankit Mhatre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitmhatree?ref=github-readme)
- **GitHub:** [github.com/ankitmhatre](https://github.com/ankitmhatre?ref=github-readme)
- **Email:** [ankitmhatre@hotmail.com](mailto:ankitmhatre@hotmail.com)

I'm always open to exciting opportunities, especially in **startups** and **high-growth environments** where I can flex both my **technical** and **product management** muscles (and maybe build something cool while we’re at it).
